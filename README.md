# Illumio-Firewall
The implementation of accept_packet function and constructor of firewall class

Firewall.java file includes all the implementation of firewall class.
Test.java includes the test I run.
test.csv is the rules I used.


Future work:
If I have more time, I will improve the speed of search. I will come up with a faster search algorithm to search for the certain rule in the file.
